Building dynamic web applications in any language is a complex job requiring intimate knowledge of hundreds of technologies and specifications. The good news, however, is that many of these requirements are universal and every web application must conform to these standards.

For example, any robust web application will need to handle request routing and provide a mechanism for the application to respond to different URLs with the appropriate response. Even a simple blog application has to handle a request to GET '/posts' to show all the recent blog posts vs a request to GET '/authors' to list all the authors.

Similarly, web applications require the ability to render templates to produce consistently structured dynamic content. A GET request to /posts/1 must render the HTML for the first post just as a request to GET '/posts/2' will render identically structured HTML but with content for the second post. This is possible because of templates.

Web frameworks take all these routine and common requirements of any web application and abstract them into code and patterns that provide these functionalities to your application without requiring you to build them yourself.

Frameworks provide structure and libraries that allow you to focus on your application and not applications in general. The bigger the framework, the more you can rely on it to provide you with common needs. The smaller the framework, the more you'll have to build things yourself.

# Sinatra
Sinatra is a Domain Specific Language implemented in Ruby that's used for writing web applications. Created by Blake Mizerany, Sinatra is Rack-based, which means it can fit into any Rack-based application stack, including Rails. It's used by companies such as Apple, BBC, GitHub, LinkedIn, and more.

Essentially, Sinatra is nothing more than some pre-written methods that we can include in our applications to turn them into Ruby web applications.

Unlike Ruby on Rails, which is a Full Stack Web Development Framework that provides everything needed from front to back, Sinatra is designed to be lightweight and flexible. Sinatra is designed to provide you with the bare minimum requirements and abstractions for building simple and dynamic Ruby web applications.

In addition to being a great tool for certain projects, Sinatra is a great way to get started in web application development with Ruby and will prepare you for learning other larger frameworks, including Rails.
