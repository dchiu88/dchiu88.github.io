I honestly don't love SQL. The first shot of going at it is difficult because unlike everything up until now it's not as easy to see step by step exactly what happens. It's helpful to articulate the concepts, as it's easy to get lost in.

First with Basics. The basics of the functional aspect of SQL is not difficult. There really are only a handful of commands to know. You have to know:
1. How to create the table
2. How to create the columns
3. How to name the columns 
4. How to select data from the tables
5. How to add columns/alter a table
6. How to delete a table
7. Data Types
8. Inserting, Updating, Selecting (and From and Where)
9. Query Functions
10. Aggregate functions (think Excel)

And actually that's the basics. After that its JOINs which are a bit complicated and I'll get into that in a bit.
